• Create a brand new app called params-game-app where you can use query parameters to tell the app your name, and the app will show your name on the screen in all caps.
rails new params-game-app
• Next make it so that if your name begins with the letter “a”, there’s a message that appears saying, “Hey, your name starts with the first letter of the alphabet!”
• Create the guess-a-number game using query parameters. (Reminder: This is the game where the app chooses a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess what it is. It also tells the user after each guess whether to guess higher or lower.) 
One caveat: Instead of having the program choosing a random number in advance, just choose a specific number, such as 36.
